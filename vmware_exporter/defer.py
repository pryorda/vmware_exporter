class BranchingDeferred(defer.Deferred):

    '''
    This is meant for code where you are doing something like this:

    content = yield self.get_connection_content()
    results = yield defer.DeferredList([
        self.get_hosts(content),
        self.get_datastores(content),
    ])

    This allows get_hosts and get_datastores to run in parallel, which is good.
    But what if you don't want the whole of get_hosts to wait for
    get_connection_content() to be complete?

    We have a bunch of places where it would be better for scheduling if we did this:

    content = self.get_connection_content()
    results = yield defer.DeferredList([
        self.get_hosts(content),
        self.get_datastores(content),
    ])

    Now we don't have to wait for content to be finished before get_hosts etc
    starts running. It is up to get_hosts to block on the content deferred itself.

    (Thats a contrived example, the real win is allowing host_labels and
    vm_inventory to run in parallel).

    Unfortunately you can't have parallel branches blocking on the same deferred
    like this with a standard Twisted deferred.

    This is a deferred that enables the parallel branching use case.

    This is a property descriptor that caches the first result it retrieves. It
    does this by setting keys in self.__dict__ on the parent class instance.
    This is fast - python won't even bother running our descriptor next time
    because attributes in self.__dict__ on a class instance trump descriptors
    on the class.

    This is intended to be used with the Collector class which has a request
    bound lifecycle (this isn't going to cache stuff forever and cause memory
    leaks).
